🤖 Postman Flows & AI Agents: ReqRes CRUD Operations
Postman API Status

✨ Introduction
Welcome to the Postman Flows & AI Agents implementation guide! This project demonstrates the power of visual API workflow automation using Postman Flows combined with AI-driven development capabilities.

What are Postman Flows? 🔄
Postman Flows is a visual programming tool that enables you to:

🎨 Build API workflows using a drag-and-drop interface
🔗 Chain multiple API requests together seamlessly
🧪 Test complex API scenarios without writing code
📊 Visualize data flow between API endpoints
⚡ Automate repetitive API testing tasks
What are Postman AI Agents? 🤖
Postman AI Agents leverage artificial intelligence to:

💬 Understand natural language requests
🛠️ Generate API requests and workflows automatically
📝 Create comprehensive documentation
🔍 Analyze API responses and suggest improvements
🚀 Accelerate API development and testing
🎯 Use Case Overview
This implementation showcases a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow using the 
ReqRes API
 - a hosted REST API for testing and prototyping.

Why ReqRes? 💡
✅ Free and publicly accessible
✅ No authentication complexity
✅ Realistic response structures
✅ Perfect for learning and demonstrations
✅ Supports all HTTP methods
Business Scenario 📋
Imagine you're building a user management system. This flow demonstrates:

Creating a new user in the system
Reading user details to verify creation
Updating user information
Deleting the user when no longer needed

4️⃣ DELETE User (DELETE) 🗑️
Endpoint: DELETE https://reqres.in/api/users/2

Purpose: Remove user from the system

Request Headers:

x-api-key: reqres-free-v1
Response: No content returned

Status Code: 204 No Content ✅

🔐 Authentication Setup
Header-Based Authentication
This flow uses API Key authentication via custom headers:

x-api-key: reqres-free-v1
Configuration Steps:
Add to Request Headers 🔑

Key: x-api-key
Value: reqres-free-v1
Applied to: All HTTP request blocks
Content-Type Header 📝

Key: Content-Type
Value: application/json
Applied to: POST and PUT requests only
Security Best Practices 🛡️
✅ Store API keys in environment variables
✅ Use Postman Vault for sensitive credentials
✅ Never commit API keys to version control
✅ Rotate keys regularly
✅ Use different keys for dev/staging/production
✅ Execution Results
